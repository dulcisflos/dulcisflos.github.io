My name is Hwasoon Kim and I finished my Ph.D. in Biostatistics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) in 2015. I am a post-doctoral research associate in the department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and a consultant in the statistical consulting center in the department of Plant, Soil, and Microbial Science in Michigan State University (MSU). My main research interest is adaptive designs in non-inferiority clinical trials particularly with survival data and quantitative and statistical genetics of complex traits and diseases. In my free time, I like practicing Ashtanga yoga and violin and traveling with my husband and my son around the world.
