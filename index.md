My name is Hwasoon Kim and I finished my Ph.D. in Biostatistics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) in 2015. I was a post-doctoral research associate focusing on statistical genetics using the UK BioBank data in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Michigan State University (MSU) and a consultant in the Statistical Consulting Center in the Department of Plant, Soil, and Microbial Science at MSU. I joined the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) as a biostatistician III and am leading several government and industry clinical trials. My main research interest is adaptive designs in non-inferiority clinical trials particularly with survival data and quantitative and statistical genetics of complex traits and diseases. In my free time, I like practicing Ashtanga yoga and violin and traveling with my husband and my son around the world.
