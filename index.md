My name is Hwasoon Kim. I am a biostatistician III at the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) and am leading several NIH-funded government and industry clinical trials. I am also managing budgets within the Clinical Trial Statistics group. My main research interest is adaptive designs in non-inferiority clinical trials particularly with survival data and quantitative and statistical genetics of complex traits and diseases. 

I finished my Ph.D. in Biostatistics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). I was a post-doctoral research associate focusing on statistical genetics using the UK BioBank data in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Michigan State University (MSU) and a consultant in the Statistical Consulting Center in the Department of Plant, Soil, and Microbial Science at MSU. 

My other passion is practicing yoga. I have completed a 200hr Yoga Teacher Training and am currently teaching colleagues and friends. I love to travel around the world with my husband and my son when I have free time.
