I am a biostatistician III at the [Duke Clinical Research Institute](https://dcri.org/) and am a lead biostatistician for several NIH-funded government and industry clinical trials. I have a broad spectrum of clinical trial experience, including several therapeutic areas, both drugs and devices studies, and both blinded and unblinded sides of clinical trial operations. I am also managing budgets within the Clinical Trial Statistics group. My main research interest is adaptive designs in non-inferiority clinical trials particularly with survival data and quantitative and statistical genetics of complex traits and diseases. 

I finished my Ph.D. in Biostatistics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. I was a post-doctoral research associate focusing on [statistical genetics using the UK BioBank data](https://www.genetics.org/content/early/2017/09/11/genetics.117.300271?versioned=true) in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Michigan State University (MSU) and a consultant in the Statistical Consulting Center in the Department of Plant, Soil, and Microbial Science at MSU. 

My other passion is practicing yoga. I have completed a 200hr Yoga Teacher Training and am teaching colleagues, friends and my husband.
