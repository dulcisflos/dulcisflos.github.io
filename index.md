My name is Hwasoon Kim and I am expecting to finish my Ph.D. in Biostatistics
at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) in the summer of 2015. My main
research interest is adaptive designs in non-inferiority clinical trials
particularly with survival data and developing a web-based sample size
calculator for non-inferiority studies. I am actively looking for a position to
further my career as an advanced biostatistician. In my free time, I like
practicing Ashtanga yoga and violin, kayaking, fencing, and traveling with my
husband around the world.
