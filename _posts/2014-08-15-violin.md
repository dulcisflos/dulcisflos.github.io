Learning how to play violin was one of two things that I want to do once I get a grown-up job, and taking tennis lessons. However, I'm doing the first one now while I'm in a graduate school. With Alex's help, I found my violin teacher, **Elizabeth Ma**, and I've been taking violin lessons for 4 months so far. We've met her at the fencing club in February and she quit fencing soon after because of her crazy school life (she is in MD/PHD program). She is a great, skillful and patient teacher. Even though she had to put the pink tapes on the finger board to help me to train my finger muscles and on my bow to give me an idea of doing slur, she is encouraging me with saying that I'm really doing good. Alex is supporting me to take her lessons even financially, which sort of enforces me to practice more often, and enduring to listen to all the scratchy sound when I practice. Oh, I have so many good people around me.
