Every year, we go to at least one restaurant that participates in [Birmingham restaurant week](http://www.bhamrestaurantweek.com/) which started last Friday. Our pick for this year was Highland Bar and Grill. It was almost booked out but I found a decent time for dinner on [Opentable.com](http://www.opentable.com/birmingham-restaurants).

Alex and I have been there three years ago, also during the restaurant week, and Alex was so concerned about his attire because he thought that he didn't have any good clothes that suit the restaurant. We live very close to the place and walk by everyday. Most customers are well-dressed and look rich with very expensive cars. Anyway, we got a lovely table right next to the window and the food was great.

After three years, we decided to try the place again and it was nice, a bit too much food for us though. Now, Alex was so ready for those kind of fancy places because he has some good suits for our wedding. He looked so perfect with [his engagement watch](http://www.uniformwares.com/watches-and-timepieces/) that he finally chose after decades of searching and I got it for him.
