We finally got our wedding bands and it was something memorable to us. We already have practiced multiple times to put it into our ring fingers. I'm sure that we will be super professional to do rings in our ceremony.

I feel so blessed that we love each other so much. I have no idea how I would live without Alex. I don't think that everybody has to get married, but having someone who loves you, trusts you, cares about you, and makes you smile at any time is just wonderful. You will feel it once you have someone.
