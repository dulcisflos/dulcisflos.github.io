*My other story related to yoga.* **Alex** finally came to the yoga class for the second time after his first try, which was pretty bad for his body. He was sore for about a week. Since then, for more than a year, he's been trying to avoid yoga and I've been trying to convince him to do yoga. He even said that it wasn't as bad as he expected afterwards. I was so happy to hear that from him. Not only Alex was there, but also **Derek**, who has done yoga in Nepal, and **Brittney**, who hasn't come to yoga class for months, were there.

I do love yoga itself but enjoying yoga with my friends is even better.

I've heard through Facebook that **Robin Williams** was found dead and it's suspected to be a suicide. His representative said he was battling severe depression. It's very sad that lots of people suffer from depression these days. Those who seem to have everything, fame, money, and their fans, have depression and kill themselves after all. It must be heartbreaking for those who love them, but it must be much harder for them to decide to end their life by choice. How terrifying they continue their life and how scary they finish their beautiful life in this world! I hope that he is in peace now.
