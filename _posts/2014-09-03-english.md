I've been living in the US for 6 years so far and everything has been nice more or less. However, English has been giving me such a hard time every single day since I'm terrible at learning languages. Wait, I know someone out there who is against this, but I still feel that way. I'm trying hard but sometimes it's not enough.

When I was in my master program in Reno, NV, my students complained about my English. My instructor delivered it to me in a nice and gentle way. I appreciate all my students who didn't speak to me directly, like 'your English sucks and I can't understand you at all'. My friend - who was in psychology at the moment and had to meet patients every day - and I - as a TA having 5 hours of practice class with about 200 students - used to agree that we would sell our soul to a devil if we can speak English fluently right away.

Currently Agustin in my department, a visiting scholar from Uruguay, feels the same, I guess. Last Thursday was Matthew's birthday and we hung out at Good People Brewery. We talked about our languages and histories, and he started asking some questions to me and Sudha that make him confused in terms of English pronunciation. That was so cute and a very sympathizing moment. It kept going on even after we left the party and were in the Blazer Express.

I still have to think whether it's 'r' or 'l', 'v' or 'b', 'f' or 'p', because Korean has one sound for them, respectively. Speaking other languages is definitely one of the hardest things in the world to me. Thankfully, Korean has vowels and consonants, like English, and Korean can pronounce most of sound in English (actually even more sounds). Alex found the Periodic Table of Hangul designed by [Darim Kim](http://www.aboutletters.com/) and it is just fabulous!

I promise here that I'll learn German vigorously for me and Alex's mom once I finish my dissertation. She's been studying English every single day since we dated and she realized that I couldn't speak German. She is purely amazing. She beat us on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/), a great app for learning languages with a very cute green owl. Her iPad is full of English learning apps and she even knew ‘otolaryngologist’. Well, I would still call them ear, nose, and throat doctors.
