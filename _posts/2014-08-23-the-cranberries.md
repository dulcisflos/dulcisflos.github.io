I don't have many favorite music bands. Off the top of my head, Sting, Dido, Imogen Heap, Keane, Kings of Convenience, The Cranberries, Owl City, Ellie Goulding, Sara Bareilles, TiÃ«sto, Icona Pop, and Emancipator that Alex Zotov recently introduced (hmmm, there are some but definitely not as many as Alex's favorites).

So, [the Cranberries](http://www.cranberries.com/) used to be my very favorite but they stopped making music at some point and I forgot about them for a long time. Well, I sometimes listened some of their songs but haven't checked whether they released a new album or not. A few days ago, I found that they reunited and released their sixth studio album 'Roses' in 2012. Super exciting! Enjoy the title song [Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jek51dK-7A&list=PL7E5DE963412A965D&index=2).

My side story about them, I've gone to their concert by myself back in college and nobody wanted to come with me to the concert. Even though I was embarrassed to be alone, since I recalled missing Sting's concert in Paris I courageously went to the concert all alone. The same thing happened for Owl City's concert in Atlanta. I guess my music preference is not in sync with my friends'.
