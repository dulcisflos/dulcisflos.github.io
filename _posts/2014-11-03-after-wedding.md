We've been really busy to deal with all the wedding stuff and to drive back and forth to the airport so far. Now, we can finally take a break and look back what happened.

After reserving the Camelia garden at the Birmingham Botanical Gardens for our ceremony, we created our wedding webpage in three different languages. It was fun and challenging to translate it to Korean and German. We designed it together and Alex wrote the code for sure. If anybody wants to take a look, here it is. [https://wedding.hwasoon.kim/](http://wedding.hwasoon.kim/) Even though our wedding prep period (4 months) was relatively short compared to others in this South, we made the best out of it, we think!

It’s been 3 weeks since I got married to Alex. We are so thankful to our families and friends who came to our wedding. Special thanks to those who were from other states and countries and those who helped us to make it happen! Without them, it would have been a disaster. As anybody else who had gone through wedding said, it was hectic. However, we were married at the end of the day and we are extremely happy and blessed. Even we got our marriage license, it is official! Our very last guest, my sister left early last week and we are getting back to our normal life..I’m having lunch in my carrel and Alex is trying to fix a bug in his code.

Even though we decided to go to our honeymoon later, probably this winter, we traveled down to Pensacola with some family members and friends, and it was really relaxing and perfect. Personally, going down to the beach later September or early October is highly recommended. My sister and Hojung were super excited to be able to watch an amazing sunrise and dolphins, like us last year when we were down there for the first time. I am sure that Alex's mom, who wanted the beach most, and Andreas were excited to see the beautiful ocean and white sand.

Now, **"keep calm and graduate"** is what I have to do.
