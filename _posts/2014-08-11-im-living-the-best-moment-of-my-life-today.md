I went to the [Magic City Asana](http://www.lululemon.com/birmingham/birmingham/events) led by my favorite yoga instructor, **Shawn Galin**, at Lululemon for the first time and thought, *'Oh my God, I'm living the best moment of my life right now. I should appreciate and remember what I have now.'* towards the end of the yoga class. It was a Aha moment. Last week, I was depressed and sad because of my slow progress of dissertation and all the other stuff. On the other hand, this is actually the best time of my life, because my dissertation is getting close to be done - even though it's very slow - and I'm getting married to the love of my life, **Alex** in October. So, I wanted to remember my feelings and thoughts about my life and our wedding preparation with Alex. Thankfully, I have a wonderful fianc√© who can set up my blog, like this and [our wedding website](http://wedding.hwasoon.kim), and now I'm writing my very first blog here. I appreciate everything around me and love my Yobo so much!
