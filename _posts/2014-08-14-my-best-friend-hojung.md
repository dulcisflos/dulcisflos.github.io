She's always been my best friend since elementary school. We have lived close, gone to the same elementary school, and our family circumstances were very similar. Even though she is the youngest and I'm the oldest child in our family - you know they have some different characteristic - we got along so well and she taught me many useful things. I guess she was more independent than me even when we were in fifth grade.

She got married 10 years ago and I'm getting married this October. She was so happy about my wedding and offered her and her husband's Korean traditional constume that they wore at their wedding. She took them to a special tailor shop to change the design a little bit and to fix sizes for us. She finally got them back today and sent me some pictures. Those are so lovely and we can't wait to try them on.

Thank you, Hojung. We can't wait to see you in Birmingham. I miss you so much.
