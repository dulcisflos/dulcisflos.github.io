This morning we had a quick Git (version control system) session led by my husband. I've got a special private tutor session with him last weekend. Otherwise, I would have been lost after 5 minutes. I just want to summarize what I've learned. I installed Git from http://git-scm.com and created a folder in the terminal on my Mac.

* git init: to create a repository
* git status: to see status in a repository
* git add [filename]: add a file/modification before commit
* git commit: to commit a file to a version
* git diff: to see differences between current and old one
* git log: to see all changes that I made
    * git log --oneline: simpler log
    * git log --patch: more specific log
    * git log --oneline graph: to see flows

From here, I have to work with GitHub https://github.com/dulcisflos.

* git clone [address from GitHub]: paste a repository copied from GitHub
* git push origin master: push the file changed in my local repository to GitHub
* git pull origin master: pull the file from GitHub to my local repository

It's pretty interesting how to track all the versions that I make in my codes. I see it's very convenient but still have to get familiar with all the commands in the black termial.
