One of my big concerns about our wedding was where I should get my hair and makeup done. I know there are many places providing the services and they are all good, but I want to spend reasonable amount of money for that. I thought doing it myself but a big NO, because I don't have enough cosmetics and skills to do that and buying all that I need for makeup would cost much more. Asking my friends is also no, because they are concerned about ruining the makeup on my wedding day and their skin tone is different from mine. I understand that.

So, I tried [Aveda Institute](http://www.avedainstitutesbb.com/birmingham-services.php) in Hoover and all the services with Aveda products are provided by students with their supervisor. I love Aveda products. They smell so relaxing and natural.

My hair designer, Andrea was a bit nervous at the beginning but my hair turned out great. She spent almost two hours and used millions of hair pins for my updo, which implies that my hair was extremely secured. I counted them later and the total number of bobby pin and hair pin used is 74! Anyway, look at my beautiful hair, it looks so lovely.
