While our awesomely outdoorsy friends were hiking on the last day of Nantahala trip, we stopped by downtown Chattanooga on our way back. Chris took us to a cafe with European atmosphere at [Bluff View Art District](www.bluffviewartdistrict.com/) (Alex admitted that). When I chilled down with cappuccino and tiramisu, I thought about a retirement plan: Alex and I own a café at somewhere pretty and quiet. We love to be in a cafe with a good coffee so it would be perfect for us. Since Matthew introduced [Church Street Coffee & Books](http://www.churchstreetshop.com/), it became our favorite café in Birmingham.

Alex wanted to look around the [Chattanooga Choo Choo Hotel](http://www.choochoo.com/) next to the microbrewery where we were supposed to have a dinner all together. The former railroad station has been converted into a resort. It is very lovely!

We've been there about three years ago when we haven't explored much around Alabama and neighbor states because we didn't have our Volvi then. Lot of things has been changed for the past three years. I couldn't even pronounce Chattanooga properly back then and wasn't familiar with all the name of place in Native Indian language. We were dating, not engaged. We both had a shorter hair and were skinnier than now. Alex used to button up all the way to his neck and didn’t have a beard. However, there are also lots of thing haven't been changed: we love and appreciate each other, we live in a same tiny place, we like to have some quality time by ourselves, and we have more friends who care about us.

Again, I live the best moment of my life!
