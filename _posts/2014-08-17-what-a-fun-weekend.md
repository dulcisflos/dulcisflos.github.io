It started with William Shakespeare's comedy play, A Midsummer Night's Dream, by the [Grassroots Shakespeare Alabama](http://www.grassrootsshakespeare.com/alabama.html) at the Trim Tab Brewing Co. - Est. 2013, one of the new microbreweries in Birmingham. There were a lot of people and so little chairs, but **Emily** had a pool chair and a cushion in her car fortunately. Their acting was so good that made me feel like I want to act like them at some point. They were delivering very clear sound and I do love to learn how to speak clearly. They seemed really enjoying what they are doing and looked so passionate.

We like to go to the [Pepper place farmer's market](http://www.pepperplacemarket.com/) for sweet pastries and Red Cat's coffee, and also love the lively atmosphere with all the people and dogs. We even got some delicious Asian pears today.

After that, we went hiking to [Ruffner mountain](http://ruffnermountain.org/) for about two hours - it felt so good and we agreed that we should go hiking more often - and we were so desperate for a pool time.

However, Alex had to see Emily's storage unit first because he only saw it in movies - American experience. After moving her stuff to her place, we finally got a pool time in the newly-opened pool in **Chris'** condo. I love swimming pools. Whether there is a swimming pool or not is my very first checklist for the next place.

It's been an awesome weekend with Alex and our good friends Chris and Emily, and I think we definitely need to chill down tomorrow.
