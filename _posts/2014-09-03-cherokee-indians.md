We had a relaxing and fun Labor Day weekend at Great Smoky Mountain area. Veny had reserved an awesome cabin with hot tub in the middle of the forests several months back. We were 14 in total but I didn't feel that's a big group, including very busy Olga and Elizabeth (they joined a day later and left early morning though). Probably everybody know each other pretty well and they all have similar attitude about community, environment and healthy life.

With Dustin's guide, who's been in this area before, we did some extreme but short hiking to the highest point in NC and to the Graveyard of dead trees that has full of wild blueberries and poisonous dark blue (sort of) berry shaped one. Again, I realized that the US takes good care of roads and trials through national forests. There were lots of good curves for bikers and Alex was missing riding a bike.

I'm getting there to talk about the Cherokee Indians. While everyone but us was having fun with duckies on the chilly white water, we went hiking with Chris' dog Penny to the Appalachian Trail that stretches out to Maine. The trail was definitely gorgeous and very quiet. After that, we stopped by downtown Cherokee with the hope of some shopping. However, we happened to be at a bonfire storytelling time by the Indians and it turned out a precious time to us. His stories about his people were fascinating and we couldn't leave to head back to the cabin as we planned. He used the word 'the creator' and I loved it. Each piece in the black and white belt that he's holding in the picture below corresponds to a story. He said that his is short and narrow and saw a great storyteller with a much wider and longer belt. I wish I have a chance to meet a Cherokee storyteller with a wide and long belt.

I don't know much about the history between Europeans who came to the new continent back then and natives who lived there for a long time, but I'm sure that the history was twisted by "the white people", as he said. I understand that would be the best strategy as a conqueror and Japan did the same thing to Korea when they colonized Korea, for example, speaking Korean was banned and Japanese was taught. The storyteller said that they don't know why they are called Indians even though they never been near India and they don't look similar. From an online class in the School of Public Health, I also learned about a native Indian tribe who got enforced to leave their town and relocated to a new place that didn't have an access to water to grow vegetables. Therefore, they depended on the foods provided by the government, which is very limited and fatty without fresh fruits and vegetables, and consequently more than 50% of their population has diabetes and coronary heart diseases. Unbelievable!

Thank you all, Veny, Philip, Chris, Emily, Yulia, Vanessa, Michelle, Dustin, Ming Yen, George, Olga, Elisabeth, Alex, and our sweet dog Penny. I had a really great time. Can't wait to see all of them soon!
