While we were sick, we watched lots of TV shows and movies. What an amazing way to start 2015! We watched Bob's Burgers, Black Mirror, Revenge, New Girl, Gotham, The Descent, Boyhood. I like to share some good stuff, but I'm not a good critic (I like all of them).

[Black Mirror](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/)

It's just like the British TV show "Sherlock" in terms of the completeness of the show and how few episode they produced per season. Each episode was made by a different director. I think the common theme is the background is a bit in the future, because the technology shown in the shows are more advanced than what we have now. There are three seasons but Netflix only has two. I guess we might stream the newest one.

The stories are very sad and sometimes sick, but I think it's quite possible to happen in real world. Very obsessed husband, very sad wife after her husband died, ... very extreme cases. The first episode in season 1 was intense. Oh, I don't want to be put in that situation.

[Boyhood](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1065073/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

These days we are so tired of smashing-everything-movies, so we try to find movies that don't belong in that category. We got pretty successful today because we watched Boyhood. This movie is about a boy, Mason, from age 5 to age 18, literally! They cast the same people for the movie for 12 years, which I learned later. Even though it's a fairly long movie, a bit less than 3 hours, when it ended, we said 'What?'. We were also very excited when Mason lived in a small town near Austin, because we just traveled to Texas over the holidays. I fell in love with the song from the movie, [Hero by Family of the Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeK0Cwr9sg).

There are a few more that I'd like to recommend. 

[Chef](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2883512/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

It's about a chef who lost his job at a restaurant in LA and he found his career in a food truck at Miami. On our last day in Austin, we had lunch at a Cuban sandwich food truck (The Texas Cuban) and asked the owner in the truck if he watched this movie. Well, he didn't but said that he will watch it in his free time. Anyway, the sandwich was delicious!

Look at the guy in the truck. How funny! Alex loves to make funny faces when he notices somebody is taking a picture and accidentally he's in the photo.

My friend in Korea recommended this movie. You can feel pure passion in the movie. The music throughout the movie is very good.

[If I stay](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1355630/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

It's about a girl who lost her family in a terrible car accident. She's trying to find the reason to come back to life while she herself is in coma. The couple in the movie is very cute. He is in a rock band and she loves playing her cello.
